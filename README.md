# Algebric arbitrary-precision library
This is a lightweight arbitrary-precision arithmetic library for large numbers manipulation using canonic algebric operators. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
The main goal is to have no memory boundary  in terms of size and make it as easy to use as possible, all arithmetical operators will be implemented in single and multithreaded workload ( and maybe in a GPU processing implementation will be added).

## Super_Int
This is still a beta project, it works but need serious optimization thou. The main class is (Super_int) for integenrs.
