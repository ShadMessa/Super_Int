# Arithmetical precision library
This is a lightweight library for large numbers manipulation. 
The main goal is to have no memory boundary  in terms of size, all arithmetical operators will be implemented in single and multithreaded workload ( and maybe in a GPU processing implementation will be added).
## Super_Int
This is still a beta project, it works but need serious optimization thou. The main class is (Super_int) for integenrs.
